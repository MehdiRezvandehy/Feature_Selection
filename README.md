# Feature_Selection

Feature selection, which means removing the irrelevant or less important features that do not contribute much to target variable, is one of the most important aspects of machine learning. Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact the performance of models and also leads to huge computational cost. Feature selection and data cleaning should be the first and most important step of model designing. In this notebook, different approaches of reducing the number of features are discussed. 

Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Feature_Selection.git) page.
